## Editing Wikipedia
##### Wikipedia Readings:  
*[Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started)  
[A Primer for Newcomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:A_primer_for_newcomers)  
[Help:Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages)*

> Editors are encouraged to be bold in editing in a fair and accurate manner with a straightforward, just-the-facts style. (*Contributing to Wikipedia*)

There was a lot of information in these articles, as well as many links to other interesting articles (some of which I read). An important take-away for me was the general style I will be expected to conform to if I am to contribute. Though I am implicitly familiar with the tone of Wikipedia, the guideline to be "bold" still surprised me. I will need to be careful of using "weasel" language, which I should probably be more aware of in all of my writing.  
It also seems like it might be hard to find a subject I have information to contribute to that I also care about (which is probably how I would have originally looked to contribute). I may need to look for pages that need heavy editing or better information sources and contribute in that way instead.

## This Week's JuliaLang Progress
This week we continued to look for issues and work individually to become more comfortable programming in Julia. We are making some progress on Issue 31202 though I think as a group we are still all a bit intimidated to make our first contribution. Hopefully more consistent group meetings will help us to make more rapid progress. (Also having finished all of our midterms should help!)

#### Issues Being Considered
###### [Issue 31402](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31402): Print Symbol("true") as Symbol("true") instead of :true
###### [Issue 443](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl/issues/443): Add features to LinkedList
###### [Issue 73](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaParser.jl/issues/73): typo  
###### [Issue 1823](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/1823): surface function in the examples  
###### [Issue 31202](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202): Documenting all exports from the standard libraries  
###### [Issue 31323](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232): the function ` __init__()` has undocumented behavior  
###### [Issue 31143](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31143): It should be mentioned in the manual that Rationals are checked for overflow
