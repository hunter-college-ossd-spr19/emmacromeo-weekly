## This Week's JuliaLang Progress
Progress continues to be slow! I somewhat regret choosing this project as I seem to be in a bit over my head. Even though there are a lot of resources, there is also a lot to wade through in the attempt to make a contribution. I am hoping to work on this a lot over break, though I know all of the members of my team will be away at varying times so a group meeting may be unlikely.
#### Issues We're Focused On
###### [Issue 31402](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31402): Print Symbol("true") as Symbol("true") instead of :true
I am still really struggling with finding the route of this issue. At this point I'm not sure whether I should move on to something else or persist a bit longer. I will see if any other members of the group can help with this issue at our next group meeting.
###### [Issue 31202](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202): Documenting all exports from the standard libraries
Documenting only the months doesn't feel like enough to make a pull request. We will attempt to do more documentation so that we can make a pull request as soon as possible.
