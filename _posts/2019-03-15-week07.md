## Progress with JuliaLang

#### Progress Learning the Language
This week, I've been working through some online tutorials to become acquainted with programming in Julia. So far I have been happy to find that the language is extremely intuitive and that the learning resources which are available are very useful. I have also read more about Julia to understand its strengths and functionality. There are many secondary sectors of the Julia language, such as libraries, that I believe my team may be able to contribute to. In the coming week I hope to meet with my team to communicate about the issues we are hoping to tackle. Arranging time to meet has been difficult this past week due to midterms.

#### Revisiting Issues
[Issue 31323](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232): the function ` __init__()` has undocumented behavior  
Currently the help documentation for Julia lacks details on the function ` __init__()`, which someone has requested be added. This issue requires reviewing the "[Module initialization and precompilation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/modules/index.html#Module-initialization-and-precompilation-1)" section of the Julia manual which details the function of ` __init__()`.

## Thoughts on Patrick Masson's Talk
I enjoyed Patrick Masson's talk. I was interested in what he named 'fauxpen source' and 'open-washing', terms that reflect problems I was already aware of but had no sufficient name for. Even his brief description of well-known software projects that exemplify these two issues peaked my interest. I also found the discussion of OS versus non-OS business models intriguing.
