## First Contributions to OSS
Small contributions that don't require the contributor to be conversant with the code base or the project's goals are often good ways to begin working on an open source project (especially for those new to OSS contribution like myself). These contributions can include writing documentation or fixing typos, which allow new contributors to become better acquainted with a project and in turn become more involved in the future. Because of my inexperience, I plan to contribute to the documentation of an OSS project I feel welcomes newcomers, in order to become familiarized with the project and the process of contributing. I will also look for projects that have bugs that are considered "easy" or "for beginners" and attempt to work on those. 

Though I would like to focus on a humanitarian project if possible this semester, what is most important to me is that I find a project I both feel passionate about and comfortable contributing to. Though I hope to commit a significant amount of time to OSS contribution both this semester and thereafter, I don't wish to set an overambitious goal. Therefore, my main goal is to have an accepted pull request to a project I am excited about.
