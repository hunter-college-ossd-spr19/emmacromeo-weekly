## This Week's JuliaLang Progress   
#### Goal: Find time to meet
Not having much time to work together in-person has begun to hinder my team's progress. We've decided it will be best to meet up on a regular basis. We have all agreed to meet up Wednesday afternoons to go over the issues we have found on our own and try to make progress on them as a group. Our first meeting will bee this coming Wednesday.

#### Goal: Continue to find issues
Hopefully meeting as a group this coming week will help us pool our resources and find some issues we can start to make progress on as soon as possible. We all agree that simple issues, such as documentation issues, will be a good way to get more comfortable contributing.

#### New Issues
###### [Issue 31202](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202): Documenting all exports from the standard libraries
This is a huge task which could be broken down into varying sizes. It already has some contributors working on it, but there is still much to do. If anything the previous pull requests for this issue act as a good example for the expectations when writing documentation.


#### Previous Issues
###### [Issue 31323](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232): the function ` __init__()` has undocumented behavior  
###### [Issue 31143](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31143): It should be mentioned in the manual that Rationals are checked for overflow
