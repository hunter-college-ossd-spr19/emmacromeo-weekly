## OS Project Selection  
### Final Selection: **[JuliaLang](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git)**

### Overall
I chose to join a team that will be contributing to the Julia programming language. Julia is defined as a "high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing" in the project's [README file](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/README.md). Julia expands upon the capabilities of existing scripting languages while being able to achieve performance comparable to C or Fortran. Type stability and multiple dispatch set Julia apart from existing languages.

#### License  
The compiler, the majority of standard library, and some utilities fall under a MIT OSS License. Other components of project have different licensing (including Python, external libraries, etc).

---
#### Code Base
**primary programming language**  
The majority of the Julia programming language is written in Julia itself, allowing Julia users to easily expand Julia and its packages, which encourages community participation. For me this will require learning a new language, which will hopefully only reinforce my interest in the project.

**project first started**  
2009

**stable release**  
Jan 2019

#### Activity Level
**maintainers**  
There are a number of maintainers for this project who actively respond to issues and pull requests.

**contributors**  
Within the last month there have been 55 contributors.

**issues**  
There are currently 38 active issues from the past week. I have noticed that many of these issues are user-based errors which are redirected to the language's help page.

**pull requests**  
There are currently 55 active pull requests from the past week.

#### Welcomeness
**CONTRIBUTING document**  
This project has a compressive contributing document that covers how to file bugs, how to submit contributions, and provides a multitude of further resources.

**CODE OF CONDUCT document**  
This project does not provide a code of conduct document on GitHub, but the [community standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/) are posted on the official Julia Lang website.

The main points are:
* Be respectful and inclusive   
* Give credit   
* Be concise   
* Get involved   

**communication & community**  
This project has both a [discussion forum on Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and a Slack channel. The forum is more active and will most likely be more useful than the Slack channel.

**other resources**  
[Many resources](https://julialang.org/community/) exist for learning and contributing to Julia, including a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage) where official tutorials are posted and other videos.
