## Communities of Practice

"communities are voluntary and organic"

A community of practice is when a group of individuals who share in something they do come together to share ideas and experiences, and to work together to improve and grow.

The article ["Cultivating Communities of Practice: A Guide to Managing Knowledge - Seven Principles for Cultivating Communities of Practice"](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/cultivating-communities-of-practice-a-guide-to-managing-knowledge-seven-principles-for-cultivating-communities-of-practice) outlines 7 principles:
1. Design for evolution.
2. Open a dialogue between inside and outside perspectives.
3. Invite different levels of participation.
4. Develop both public and private community spaces.
5. Focus on value.
6. Combine familiarity and excitement.
7. Create a rhythm for the community.

Many of these principles reflect the ideas that have allowed open source projects to succeed in the past.

## This Week's JuliaLang Progress
#### Group Meeting
Our team met this week to figure out how to make progress with Julia and ultimately make pull requests that (we hope) will be accepted. We shared what issues we were looking at individually and discussed what we were feeling intimidated by. This was the first of our weekly meetings, and it felt like a good starting point.

#### Action Plan
We are all going to look into the first steps of contributing to the issues we have collected by our meeting next week. At our meeting we will be sharing the problems we have run into and deciding which issues deserve further pursuit.

#### New Issues
###### [Issue 31402](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31402): Print Symbol("true") as Symbol("true") instead of :true
###### [Issue 443](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl/issues/443): Add features to LinkedList
###### [Issue 73](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaParser.jl/issues/73): typo
I need to look into this issue more. It seems that the person that created it did so with the intention of creating a pull request to solve it but never did. It might be an easy pull request.
###### [Issue 1823](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/1823): surface function in the examples
This issue is to add a useful example to demonstrate the surface function, it would require an understanding of the surface function. I will be looking into it to determine how easy an issue it will be to contribute to.

#### Previous Issues
###### [Issue 31202](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202): Documenting all exports from the standard libraries  
We've decided that this is a good issue for us to work on. I'd like to look through the standard libraries that need documentation and determine which I think would be best to attempt to document.
###### [Issue 31323](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232): the function ` __init__()` has undocumented behavior  
###### [Issue 31143](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31143): It should be mentioned in the manual that Rationals are checked for overflow
