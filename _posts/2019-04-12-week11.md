## Interview with Linus Torvalds
##### Reading: "[25 Years Later: Interview with Linus Torvalds](25 Years Later: Interview with Linus Torvalds)"  
Take-away: I'm not sure I really had a take-away from this reading. It was interesting but not super relevant to me.

## This Week's JuliaLang Progress

#### Issues We're Focused On
###### [Issue 31402](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31402): Print Symbol("true") as Symbol("true") instead of :true
We will need to contact the person who claimed this issue but they don't seem to be making progress and/or working on it actively. Hopefully they have stopped working on it and we can takeover.  
I have attempted to find the route of this issue in anticipation and have not yet made significant progress. Perhaps as a team we will have better success or the previous contributor will have some insight.
###### [Issue 31202](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31202): Documenting all exports from the standard libraries
This issue is great for us as a team because of the number of accepted pull requests we have as reference. Right now we are focussed on determining which exports we want to document, and then work to understand them as well as possible. It is still very difficult for me to read and interpret Julia so this remains a bit of a challenge.

#### Other Issues
We are still considering and/or keeping an eye on these issues however they are no longer our main focus.
###### [Issue 443](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl/issues/443): Add features to LinkedList
###### [Issue 73](https://github.com/JuliaLang/JuliaParser.jl/issues/73): typo  
###### [Issue 1823](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/1823): surface function in the examples   
###### [Issue 31323](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31232): the function ` __init__()` has undocumented behavior  
###### [Issue 31143](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/31143): It should be mentioned in the manual that Rationals are checked for overflow
